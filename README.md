# GoodTime v2

An understandable language runtime for studying, hacking and education.

Performance and wellness matter, but for this project, making things clearly explained is more important.

## How to use

1. Choose language implement folder, like `/go` or `/js`
2. The most simple way to try is build a Docker image by the `Dockerfile` in the directory,
3. And then run: `docker run -p 8080:8080 <image tag>` then open the browser at `http://localhost:8080` (or any host port you want to map to)
